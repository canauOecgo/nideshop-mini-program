# How to Get Plagiarism Checker X Serial Key 2017 for Free
 
Plagiarism Checker X is a powerful software that can help you detect and avoid plagiarism in your academic papers, blogs, articles, and other online content. It can compare your text with billions of web pages and documents in various formats, such as PDF, DOC, DOCX, RTF, TXT, and HTML. It can also generate detailed reports with percentage of similarity, sources of plagiarism, and originality score.
 
If you want to use Plagiarism Checker X for free, you might be tempted to look for a serial key or a crack online. However, this is not a good idea for several reasons. First of all, using a pirated software is illegal and unethical. You might be violating the intellectual property rights of the developers and exposing yourself to legal consequences. Second, downloading a crack or a keygen from an unknown source can be risky for your computer. You might end up installing malware, viruses, or spyware that can harm your system or steal your personal information. Third, using a cracked software can compromise the quality and accuracy of your plagiarism check. You might not get the latest updates, features, and support from the official website.

Plagiarism Checker X is a reliable and efficient tool that can help you improve your writing and avoid plagiarism. However, it is not a substitute for your own originality and creativity. You still need to cite your sources properly and paraphrase or quote them correctly. You also need to respect the work of others and give credit where it is due.
  
However, using Plagiarism Checker X is not enough to ensure that your work is original and ethical. You also need to follow some basic guidelines on how to avoid plagiarism in your writing. Here are some tips that can help you:
 
- Cite your source whenever you use someone else's ideas or words, whether you quote them directly or paraphrase them in your own words. Use a citation style that is appropriate for your field and your audience, such as APA, MLA, or Chicago. You can find more information on how to cite sources correctly on the Scribbr website[^1^].
- Include quotations marks around any text that you copy verbatim from a source. Don't change or omit any words within the quotation, and make sure to cite the source after the quotation. You can also use block quotes for longer passages that are indented from the rest of the text.
- Paraphrase the source's ideas or information in your own words, without changing the meaning or the tone. Don't just replace a few words with synonyms or change the word order. Try to express the main points in a different way, using your own voice and style. You still need to cite the source when you paraphrase.
- Summarize the main idea or argument of a source in a few sentences, without including any details or examples. A summary should give an overview of what the source is about, without copying any phrases or sentences from it. You also need to cite the source when you summarize.
- Use a plagiarism checker before you submit your work to make sure that you have not accidentally copied any text from your sources or from other online sources. Plagiarism Checker X can help you detect and avoid plagiarism, but it is not a substitute for your own careful editing and proofreading.
- Avoid using online sources that are unreliable, untrustworthy, or unethical. These include websites that offer pre-written essays, papers, or dissertations for sale or for free. These sources are likely to be plagiarized themselves, and using them can damage your reputation and credibility.
- Develop your own original ideas and arguments based on your research and analysis. Don't rely too much on your sources or copy their opinions or perspectives. Instead, use them as evidence or support for your own claims and interpretations. Show your critical thinking and creativity in your writing.

By following these tips, you can avoid plagiarism and produce high-quality academic work that is honest and respectful of others' intellectual property rights.
